# AstroBlocks: A Private Blockchain Application

I created AstroBlocks to demonstrate my familiarity with the fundamental concepts of a Blockchain platform.

## What problem does AstroBlocks solve?

AstroBlocks is a proof of concept application created to allow users to register and track ownership of stars using a private blockchain.

### How does it work?

1. The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.
2. The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. The message format will be: `<WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry`;
3. Once the user have the message the user can use a Wallet to sign the message.
4. The user will try to submit the Star object for that it will submit: `wallet address`, `message`, `signature` and the `star` object with the star information.
    The Star information will be formed in this format:
    ```json
        "star": {
            "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
            "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
            "story": "Testing the story 4"
		}
    ```
5. The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership (the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is less than 5 minutes.
6. If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and added to the `chain`
7. The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an owner (wallet address). 


## How to test AstroBlocks?
1. Run the application using the command `node app.js`
You should see in your terminal a message indicating that the server is listening in port 8000:
> Server Listening for port: 8000

2. To make sure your application is working fine and it creates the Genesis Block you can use POSTMAN to request the Genesis block:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/block/0 ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca360cc_request-genesis/request-genesis.png)
3. Make your first request of ownership sending your wallet address:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/requestValidation ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
4. Sign the message with your Wallet:
    ![Use the Wallet to sign a message](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
5. Submit your Star
     ![Request: http://localhost:8000/submitstar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca365d3_signing-message/signing-message.png)
6. Retrieve Stars owned by me
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/blocks/<WALLET_ADDRESS>](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca362b9_retrieve-stars/retrieve-stars.png)
